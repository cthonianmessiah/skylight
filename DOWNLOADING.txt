# Requires elevated permissions on Windows

To install the Skyfield and requests modules into Blender's python environment (Windows):
The "skyfield" module is needed to interact with the NASA ephemeris calculation modules (SPICE kernels).
The "requests" module is needed to allow the addon to download files to its assets folder.
You can skip installing the "requests" module if you intend to download the assets manually.

1. Open a command prompt with elevated permissions.
2. Find the install of python.exe, by default it is located at:
   C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 4.0\4.0\python\bin\python.exe
3. Run "python -m ensurepip" to make sure the pip package manager is available.
4. Run "python -m pip install skyfield". This should download and install the skyfield module.
5. Run "python -m pip install requests". This should download and install the requests module.


# Should not require elevated permissions, the plugin should be able to do this.

To find the addon folder on Windows (this example is for Blender 4.0):
C:\Users\[you]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.0\scripts\addons\skylight\assets

To download the de421 SPICE kernel used to calculating ephemeris:

1. Download https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/JUNO/kernels/spk/de421.bsp
2. Save the downloaded .bsp file in the assets subfolder as "skylight/assets/de421.bsp".
3. Reinitialize the addon by toggling its checkmark in the addon list.

To download the sky texture:

1. Go to https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4851/#media_group_319116 and choose your preferred resolution of .exr texture.
  Higher resolutions may fail to load in Blender, we're working on optimizing support by
  simplifying the generated lighting.
2. Save the texture in the skylight addon in the assets subfolder as "skylight/assets/sky.exr".
3. Reinitialize the addon by toggling its checkmark in the addon list.

To download the moon texture:

1. Go to https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4874/#media_group_318381 and choose youre preferred resolution of .mp4.
   The high-resolution video has been tested and is functional, although it might not be necessary unless
   you intend to render extreme closeups.
2. Save the video file in the skylight addon in the assets subfolder as "skylight/assets/moon.mp4".
3. Reinitialize the addon by toggling its checkmark in the addon list.
